This is a program that I wrote for a small business that I owned in Indiana PA. It was a personal training facility and I had between 35 and 40 clients. 
A large part of my duties as a personal trainer was to write workout programs for clients, taking about 8 hours per week. 
**I wrote a Java program that could effectively replace me at my own job.** The program would create a profile for a new user and ask the same questions 
that I would ask a new client in the gym. The goal of these questions was to gauge ability level. With that ability level, 
the program would return a weekly workout routine personalized for the user. **This program saved me roughly 8 hours a week.**  


I was a sophmore computer science student when I wrote this program, so it is by no means perfect. But it was a good project to learn with becuase I was 
fixing a problem that I understood very well. I also wrote code for a website for this same business and I plan to convert this code to javascript and hook the 
workout generator up to the webpage.
